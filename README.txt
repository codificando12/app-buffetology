This is a bot that will make a Chinese stock filtre.
First it will enter in tradingview.com and get all chinese stock numbers, 
then it will click in each share and get the price, earnings per share(EPS),
get the past 7 years historical EPS and save all the data in "acciones.xlsx".
It will only filtre the stocks depending on the return rate, if the return 
rate is higher than 15%, if it is higher than 10% and so on until it is less
than 0%.
Also, I would like to make you know that this is one of the first project tha I have 
done with selenium and at that moment I didn't know anything about POO, so it is an
spaguetti code.
